Bus event data was downloaded from MassDOT's OpenData portal:
(https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/MassDOT::mbta-bus-arrival-departure-times-2023/about).
The data analyzed here are from the month of June 2023.
This data was paired with the GTFS archive for each day in the following manner:
The GTFS trips for each route on each day were used to calculate the scheduled headway at each stop
Each arrival event was then assigned the nearest scheduled headway preceeding it.
The actual headways were compared to these scheduled headways for trips M-F 7a-19p.
A bus was determined to be bunched if the actual headway was < 0.25 * the scheduled headway
[[ this is up for debate, I've analyzed the data a few ways, we can pick what we want to do]]
The following routes were not included in this analysis:
171, 191, 192, 193, 194, CT2, CT3, and the Silver Line.

(Possibly we will filter by minimum number of trips required to be measured on headway standards.)
