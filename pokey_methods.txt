Bus event data was downloaded from MassDOT's OpenData portal:
(https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/MassDOT::mbta-bus-arrival-departure-times-2023/about).
The data analyzed here are from the month of June 2023.
These event data were combined with the shapes data from MBTA's GTFS archive for June 15, 2023.
We selected only those trips that had a timepoint at the most common starting-terminus and ending-terminus
for each route and used these timepoints to calculate the duration of each trip.
The distance between the termini was calculated along the route's representative trip's shape.
The "day" speeds and counts include trips departing the starting-terminus between the hours of 7am and 18:59pm M-F.
The "offhour" speeds and counts include all trips outside of this selection.
The total speeds includes all trips.

There are a few anomalies in the data that one should be wary of:
Firstly, some routes like the 85 had very few timepoints in the data.
Secondly, if any routes have multiple route patterns with the same starting- and ending-termini
  we may be using the wrong distance for some trips. This can lead to inaccuracies.
    [ we will need to audit any metrics we publish for this issue. ]
  I think I noticed this with the 62, for instance. We'll have to be careful.
Lastly, there are several routes that had either no representative route pattern, or multiple.
  These were not included in this analysis. Those routes are:
  4, 137, 16, 191, 192, 193, 194, 222, 225, 29, 351, 40, 411, 451, 95, CT2, CT3, and the Silver Line.
  Several routes had the above issue when analyzing a single direction. Those routes are: [i=inbound, o=outbound]
  119i, 171i, 240o, 33o, 354i, 439o, 501i, 70i, 76i.
